The Church of God's Word is the vision of a great man, a man named Ellis
Vincent. He alone, of all the scientists on the Mount who heard the signals,
recognized them for what they were, the Word of God.|
|
The Holy Prophet was ridiculed and persecuted for his beliefs, but he had the
strength that comes from knowing the Truth, and Followers began to hear those
Truths and flock around him. They grew in numbers and in strength, and when
the Evil Scientists of the Mount attempted to bar Vincent from the instruments
there, he and his Followers rose up and smote the Evil Scientists.|
|
And so it came to pass, in 2025, that the Temple was founded on the Mount,
and the Instrument of the Word was devoted entirely to listening to God's
Word. Vincent interpreted the Words for his Followers, who broadcast the
Message around the world, and branches of the Church appeared in many cities.|
|
When Vincent finally became very old, and God began to beckon his servant
to his side, he taught the wisest of his Followers how to interpret the
Word, so that the world would continue to understand the Word after he
was gone. These Followers became the High Priests of the Church, who to
this day continue to pass along God's Word.\"" CR>)

Ever since the brave crusade of the Holy Prophet Vincent against the evil

from the heavens.|
|
The Lord Most High has been growing angry at His flock -- angry that there are
some who do not heed His Word. He is sending a sign, a fiery star that will
soon burn in our nighttime skies, to warn us that all created in His image
must become brethren of His Church. The punishment for not doing so will be
swift and cruel, and directed not just against the sinners but against all of
mankind, such that all will suffer for the sins of the few.|
|
Our Father and Creator is demanding, but He is also generous and kind. When
the day arrives that all men have joined His Church and heed His Word, he
will bring down upon the Earth an epoch of such peace and beauty as the
world has not seen since Eden. The choice He gives us is simple: Turn away

He has instructed that new Worship Camps for the Unpure be opened in
every part of His favorite nation. He has instructed that these be
filled with more of the Beasts in Human Form, who have not joined the
Church, or who are not considered fit to join the Church, so that they
may be purified and sent to meet Him.|
|
He has instructed that only the officials of the Church may hold
governmental posts, in order to speed His work and facilitate the
dawning of the new Eden. He has, in his generosity, increased the
number of slaves a Churchman may own, from twenty-five to fifty.|

Another major story covers President Ryder's speech for the Distinguished
Lecturer Series of the Border Security Force Academy. In his address, the
President called the '40s a \"decade of new hope,\" and attributed much of
that new hope to the work of the BSF, sending a signal to the entire world
that the USNA \"won't be pushed around by the biggest dictatorship or the

On one of the inside pages, an in-depth report on crime reveals that,
although the overall crime rate has dropped only 4% over the last decade,
public perception is that crime has fallen much further. The report
attributes this perception to three points: Violent crime has decreased
much faster than other types of crime, and is down by 15% from ten years
ago. Crime in the schools, which has always gotten the most publicity,
has dropped by 40%. Most importantly, offenders are getting harsher
sentences, as opposed to the old days of getting off on technicalities,
low bail, and easy parole.|

decline to a year of unseasonable cold and low rainfall, and predicted that the
coming year would more than make up for it. An alternative viewpoint was
expressed by the head of the American Association of Agribusiness, who claimed
the drop was caused by overfarming of lands, depletion of aquifers, and an
increase in acid rain, and called for a massive government program to save the
country's farms.|

the announcement by Huang Laboratories that without subsidized shuttle flights
it would be forced to close GEO-7, the last remaining space factory; committee
