unrecognizable, sending shivers through you. He raises a fur-clad arm,
pointing at his mother without a hint of emotion. \"She spake against the
Church; she tried to poison the mind of a child too young to know the Truth.\"
The thugs grab Jill, who reaches toward Mitchell, tears of terror streaming
down her face. Totally unresponsive, he turns and walks calmly out of the
apartment.|
