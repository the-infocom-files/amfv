\"I've criticized the shiftless troublemakers in our nation often enough. But
I also question the moral decay of our society that turns potentially fine
young lads into shiftless troublemakers in the first place! Is it possible
we've forgotten the basics of discipline, and misplaced the ability to instill
the simple fundamentals of a humane society in our youths?\"|

\"Yesterday, I spoke to a man who waited for eleven hours at the local branch
of the Federal Firearms Agency, just to get a permit for a gun so he could
protect his family and his home. Now, anyone who knows me knows I haven't got
a darn thing against legitimate functions of government. But when regulations,
paperwork, and flim-flam bureaucracy get so out of hand that it interferes
with a man's simple, decent attempt to protect his loved ones and personal
property, then I say it's time for a drastic change.\"|
|
\"Last year, this country subsidized sick, inefficient, dying industries to
the tune of eighty billion dollars. Now, that's a lot of dough. Let's say
you're Joe Average-Taxpayer. Last year, you made $90,000 and, if you're
honest, you paid about $48,000 in taxes. That means that you spent about $400
so that Penn Steel or Powell Computers or KGN Media Services could stay in
business. There are a lot of things Joe could do with that 400 bucks, and
almost every one of them would have a healthier effect on our economy than
life support for some archaic industry.\"|

\"A lot of bleeding hearts these days are talking about how we ought to be
sending a lot of money and stuff to countries that aren't as lucky as us.
These misguided souls seem to think we're some kind of bottomless well of
wealth, and they can just keep shipping that well water around the world,
telling their thirsty little friends, 'No need for you to knuckle down and
solve your problems -- we'll keep bailing you out!' And who are some of these
poor little countries we're talking about? Greece! Guatemala! North Korea!
Albania! The same countries that are always against the USNA in every issue,
every forum, every two-bit propaganda show. I think I speak for a majority of
my fellow citizens when I say, 'Let's start looking after our own interests
first!'\"|

\"Yes, the problems of the nation are many, the troubles of the world are
great. There is widespread despair among the people, and a clarion call
cries out: 'Why? Why must this be so?' And now, electrified by the power
of those cries, clouds of change are gathering on the horizon. Clouds that
signify not another storm, but the dawning of a new day! A new day of
growth, of prosperity, of hope, of reawakened moral values, of streamlined
government, of respect for our country at home and abroad! The Plan for
Renewed National Purpose would bring all that and more. The road is long,

"The following excerpts are from a position paper issued by Citizens
for Sanity in Government, a political action committee working for the
reelection of President William Bowden:|
|
\"Many of today's domestic problems, such as joybooth safety, high energy
costs, or residual acidity in our precipitation, exist not because of
sophisticated government regulation, but despite it.\"|
|
\"Subsidization of industries caught in a changing economic environment is
a temporary measure, vital to avoid severe, localized unemployment while
retraining workers for healthier industries.\"|
|
\"Global instability is exploited by East Bloc adventurism, not caused by it.
Instability is the result of underdevelopment and overpopulation, and it will
be cured not by militarization of these regions, but by development aid and
education. These programs, expensive in this generation, will have tremendous
paybacks in the years ahead.\"|
|
\"The Plan's supporters are blatantly hypocritical. They call for
old-fashioned laissez-faire capitalism, but at the same time they promise
protectionist restrictions on trade imports. They pay lip service to the
advantages of technological advance, but they quietly prepare to decimate
funding for medical research, space exploration, and higher education.\"|
|
\"The elements of the misnomered Plan for Renewed National Purpose are either
dangerous overreactions to admittedly serious problems, or misguided concepts
lacking any merit whatsoever. The Plan is the work of hypocrites and
demagogues, clamoring for power by making promises they can never keep.
Today's complex problems need and deserve sober, deliberate, difficult
solutions, not cosmetic quick-fixes which sound inviting but promise even
bigger problems further down the road.\"")>

"(Phoenix) (10/11/30) In a case with far-reaching implications, the Arizona
Supreme Court has ruled that state authorities cannot evict members of a
religious sect from the radio telescope facility atop Greens Peak.|
|
The sect, a group of extremists calling itself the Church of God's Word,
seized the facility in December of 2027, after group founder Ellis Vincent,
59, a minor engineer at the facility, claimed that signals emanating from a
region in the constellation Cygnus were the revealed word of God.|
|
Although scientists once thought those signals might be a message from
another intelligent race, light-years distant, most scientists now attribute
the signals to a new type of quasar at the fringes of our universe. Despite
this, members of the sect continue to believe that Greens Peak, which they
call \"The Mount,\" is a holy site, and the radio telescope is the \"ear for
hearing the word of God.\"|
|
A spokesman for the sect, Holy Keeper Sergei Korn, hailed the ruling as a sign
of divine providence and revealed plans for constructing a temple there.
Larron Hart, chairman of the American Foundation for Astronomical Research
(AFAR), which built and ran the Greens Peak facility, expressed disgust at
what he termed \"a historically stupid decision,\" and vowed to appeal.|
|
The Church of God's Word, which received a great deal of media attention from
the occupation of Greens Peak, has been growing rapidly during the past three
years, and it now claims twenty thousand adherents worldwide. Vincent, who is
referred to by his followers as the Holy Prophet, has not been seen in public
since the takeover.")>

"(Vancouver) (2/6/31) The prestigious Manning Institute has released a study,
entitled \"The Tax Spiral: A Vicious Cycle,\" which details how nonreporting
and underreporting of income is undermining the current tax structure. The
study concludes that, unless changes are made, the federal revenue system
could collapse by the end of the decade.|
|
The Tax Spiral is the phenomenon where high rates cause more people to
cheat on their taxes, necessitating even higher rates, causing even more
people to cheat, and so forth. Economists believe that the current tax
spiral began in the late twentieth century.|
|
The following chart shows the growth of the \"underground\" economy --
income nonreported and therefore not taxed:|

"(Tripoli) (1/8/31) During 2030, Libya became a net exporter of oil for the
first time since the 1998 nuclear accident that poisoned most of the Libyan
oil fields.|
|
The turnaround was due to the opening of the first of six new refineries
around the Gulf of Sidra. As the other five facilities are activated during
the next three years, Libyan oil will add around seven percent to the world's
petroleum supply. Experts predict that such a global oil glut would plunge
the price of crude as much as twenty-five percent from its current price of
$160 per barrel.|
|
The accident that decimated Libya's petroleum industry was allegedly caused
by a mishandled attempt to develop a nuclear capability. The acquisition of
a nuclear arsenal was a lifelong dream of former Libyan dictator Muammar
Kaddafi, who perished in the blast along with nearly a million of his
countrymen.")>

"(Colorado Springs) (11/17/30) Congress has approved the establishment
of the Border Security Force as a separate, independent uniformed
military service, to be headquartered in the Colorado facility known
as the \"Pentagon of the West.\"|
|
Since its creation in 2021, the BSF has been jointly administered by the U.S.
Army and the CIA. Today's action makes the BSF the seventh branch of the Armed
Forces, joining the Army, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, Air Force and Space
Force.|
|
Commander Rile McLoughlin, the current chief of the BSF, said that the BSF
now has \"the leeway we need to take the tough stance and courageous steps
necessary to keep our nation free from the threat of nuclear blackmail.\"|
|
The BSF was established by Executive Order in 2021, after the completion of
the USNA's TROY antimissile shield and the East Bloc's counterpart system
fundamentally altered the East-West nuclear arms race from the building of
missiles to the smuggling of miniature bombs.|
|
In its first nine years, the BSF has thwarted 13 attempts to bring fully armed
nuclear devices into the USNA, as well as countless attempts to smuggle
various parts and supplies that could be used for the construction of nukes.
It is unknown whether any bombs have actually penetrated the American border.|
|
USNA and BSF officials have never confirmed the supposition that the BSF's
secret charter also empowers it to smuggle nuclear devices into the territory
of the East Bloc.|
|
The prevention of nuclear smuggling is expected to become even more difficult
with the development of the nobelium bomb, a nuclear device which can
theoretically fit in a space no larger than a pack of cigarettes.")>

Through the window of the skycab, you can see the sleek, white shuttle waiting

would be more than just another space colony. It was the pinnacle of an eon
of human achievement, the first step into interstellar space.|

You and Jill would never live to see the completion of that first step,
generations hence. (Although in the germfree, low-gee environment of a
habitat, and with the recent strides in health and longevity research, who
could say for sure?) But you would still have been part of that dawning of
a new age, that future of unlimited potential. Humanity was beginning a
journey into the universe, a voyage that would last forever.">
